# DevLab

DevLab is my place to practice and try out new stuff in the .NET and C# world.  
I use this repo to test ideas, play with frameworks, check out libraries, and get better at backend development.

You’ll find random projects, snippets, and experiments here — things like ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, clean architecture, testing, and whatever else I feel like exploring.

This isn’t a polished or production-ready repo. It’s just a lab where I break things, fix them, and learn in the process.

Feel free to look around if you’re curious!
